# FastAPI - Simple CRUD

I mostly followed FastAPI's docs for learning how to use this awesome framework.
I built a simple CRUD API with Companies and Users, nothing fancy since this project's goal is learning about FastAPI.

## How to run

Create a virtualenv and activate it (recommended):

`$ python3 -m virtualenv venv`

`$ source venv/bin/activate`

Install all dependencies:

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run uvicorn:

`$ uvicorn app:app --reload`

The `reload` flag will reload the server on any file changes and is optional.

Access <http://localhost:8000/api/v1/docs> to see the documentation that was autogenerated by FastAPI. There you can make all requests available to the API v1.

This app was developed using SQLite as the main database and by default will use an in-memory instance. You can override this behaviour by defining an enviroment variable for a connection string to your database of choice (although I didn't test for anything except SQLite)

If you wish to change the connection string:

`$ export SQL_URL='sqlite://'`

Then re-run uvicorn

`$ uvicorn app:app --reload`
